## Control

Here, I'll be doing what my current experience suggests I should.

I'll also be using this to document a good sequence of behaviors to add.
I'll try to figure out a feature/bug fix that represents a logical next step, but will be non-trivial to implement given the current state of the code.
This way, I can compare other solutions to problems encountered from my default position.
